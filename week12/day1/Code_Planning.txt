0. Specify the goal of your program. (eg. why will it be good, what will it do)
1. Specify the design. (eg. what to copy)
2. Specify the features it will include. (eg. every single features)
3. Specify how the user will interact with it. (eg. buttons, inputs)

Controller object
    Every input and output goes through this object. (Central Processing Unit)
    This invokes the functions in other objects.

Inner processing object
    This object sends and receives data from the controller.
    This object does all the inner calculations and program logic.

Drawer object
    This object can draw. I mean only this can draw. Even the dynamic HTML tags.
    This object receives data from the controller.

Input handler object
    This object sets up the eventListeners and every input elements.
    This object sends data to the controller.

Frontend server object
    This object communicates with the backend.
    This object sends and receives data from the controller and the backend server.

Backend server object
    This object communicates on the server side with the Frontend server object.
    This can be a totally separate project. Need to define API!

Every object can have one or more inner object(s) or support object(s) if the better code structure requires it.
